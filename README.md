# Interview Practice Problems

This repository contains my solutions to various coding problems that I have been practicing in preparation for coding interviews. The problems are sourced from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com/).

Each problem is presented in a separate directory, with the problem statement and any relevant information provided in a README file. Within each directory, you will find a solution file containing my implementation of the solution, as well as any additional files required to run the solution (such as input files).

The problems are organized by data structure, with each directory containing problems that involve the same data structure. Currently, the data structures included are:

- Array
- Linked List
- Hashing and Hash Tables
- Binary Tree
- Graph
- Queue
- Stack
- General Concepts

I have primarily used JavaScript for my solutions, but I may include solutions in other languages as well.

## Usage

To view my solutions, simply navigate to the directory for the desired problem and open the solution file in your preferred code editor. To run the solution, you can either copy and paste the code into a JavaScript REPL or run the code from the command line.

Please note that these solutions are intended for personal use and may not be the most optimal or efficient solutions for each problem. They are simply a reflection of my thought process and problem-solving approach.
