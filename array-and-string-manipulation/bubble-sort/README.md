## Question:
Given a list of integers, sort the list using bubble sort and count the number of swaps needed to completely sort the list. Additionally, implement a method to optimize the bubble sort algorithm to minimize the number of swaps and compare the results.

## Follow-up questions:

Can you explain how bubble sort works?
- What is the time complexity of bubble sort? Can you explain why?
- What are the primary advantages and disadvantages of bubble sort compared to other sorting algorithms, such as quick sort and merge sort?
- Can you identify any real-world applications where bubble sort might be a suitable choice for sorting data?

Note:
The main goal of this question is to test the candidate's understanding of bubble sort and its implementation. The optimization part of the question refers to the fact that bubble sort can be improved by stopping the algorithm early if no swaps are made during a pass through the list, indicating that the list is already sorted.
