## Problem:
Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array that is sorted in ascending order using the Merge Sort algorithm. Ensure that all negative numbers appear before all positive numbers, and zeroes (if any) appear between negative and positive numbers.

## Follow up questions:

- What is the time complexity of your function? How did you derive it?
- What is the space complexity of your function? How did you derive it?
- What are the advantages and disadvantages of Merge Sort compared to other sorting algorithms?
- How would you modify your function to sort the array in descending order, while keeping negative numbers before positive ones?
- How would you modify your function to sort an array of strings alphabetically, but keep a specific pattern (e.g., vowels before consonants)?
