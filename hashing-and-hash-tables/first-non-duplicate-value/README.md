# First Non-Duplicated Character

## Problem Statement

Write a function that returns the first non-duplicated character in a string. For example, the string "minimum" has two characters that only exist onceâ€”the "n" and the "u", so your function should return the "n", since it occurs first. The function should have an efficiency of O(N).

## Examples

1. For the input string "minimum", the function should return "n".
2. For the input string "abracadabra", the function should return "c".
3. For the input string "aabbccddeeffg", the function should return "g"
