## Problem Statement

Write a function that returns the intersection of two arrays. The intersection is a third array that contains all values contained within the first two arrays. For example, the intersection of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] is [2, 4]. Your function should have a complexity of O(N). (If your programming language has a built-in way of doing this, donâ€™t use it. The idea is to build the algorithm yourself.)

# Examples

```
Example 1:
Input: array1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9], array2 = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]
Output: [3, 5, 7]

Example 2:
Input: array1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], array2 = [5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55]
Output: []

Example 3:
Input: array1 = [21, 42, 63, 84, 105], array2 = [7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, 91, 98, 105]
Output: [21, 42, 63, 84, 105]
